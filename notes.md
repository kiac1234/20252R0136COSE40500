# COSE405 Final Assignment Notes
- Commit 1: created notes file
- Big-O: O(n), O(log n), O(n log n) examples
- Stack vs Queue: LIFO vs FIFO
- Hash table: average O(1), collisions handled by chaining
- Sorting: quicksort average O(n log n), worst O(n^2)
- Graph: BFS uses queue, DFS uses stack/recursion
- OS: process vs thread
- Networking: TCP vs UDP
- Database: normalization reduces redundancy
- Git: commit is a snapshot, push uploads to remote
